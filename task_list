 * build a ""NEW"" ruw_lock, this is reader lock, upgradable reader lock and writer lock
   states => 	R = reader lock => do not change data
   				U = upgradable lock => do not change data
   				W = writer lock => data can be modified

   transitions allowed N = no lock
   N -> R|U|W
   R|U|W -> N

   U -> W

   W -> U 	basically a downgrade
   U -> R 	basically a downgrade
   W -> R 	basically a downgrade

   There can only be one writer or upgradable reader thread
   Other Readers can coexist with upgradable reader,
   Readers can not be upgraded what so ever, only upgradable readers can be promoted to become writers

   There is waiting for new readers, new upgradable readers and new writers
   There is no waiting state for any transitions between them
 * provide a rwl lock a lighter implementation of the same reader writer lock
