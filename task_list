(*future)
  * a mutex will have lock compatibility matirx as below (if implemented using glock)
           LOCK
    LOCK   0
  * a rwlock's lock compatibility matrix, in terms of glock could possibly look like this
           Read  Write
    Read   1     0
    Write  0     0
  * a template initialization of this lock_compatibility matrix should look like this
  lock_compatibility_matrix m = {
    3,
    (uint8_t[ (3 * (3+1)) / 2 ]){
          0,
          1,2,
          3,4,5
    },
  };
